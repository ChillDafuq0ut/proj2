I tried to fix the problems but I'm not sure what the issue was with the lidar/camera, as the only details given was that it was Xed out. I the problems with  " Launch the world (which includes a white ball)" and "housed inside the world" were about it not having its own set world. I wasn't sure what the requirements were for another world so I made a new world with just white balls surrounded by walls with the robot inside.
